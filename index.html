        I was talking to a friend of mine. He mentioned that, he had just 
        turned thirty, and that forced him to re-evaluate his life, and led
        to him making a big life decision.
      </p>

      <p class="para2">
        This shocked me. He was my age. Oh no wait. He was a little older. A
        year and change. So that means <i>very soon</i>, I too would be turning thirty.
      </p>

      <p class="para3">
        Wow. Okay. I get that it's just a number. But it still is definitely something that
        forces you to reconsider things.
      </p>

      <p class="para4">
        So I made what I consider to be a <i>very</i> wise decision. Let me
        preempt the sudden dawning of a realization, and rather, use it as a
        driving force.

      <p class="emph"> A list. </p>

      <p class="para5">
        Let me create a list of all the things that I want to do before I
        turn thirty. Lets take that <i>deadline</i>, and turn it into a
        <i>target.</i>
      </p>

      <p class="para6">
        I wanted to take my <i>last</i> year of my twenties and make it
        the <i>best</i> year of my twenties.
      </p>

      <p class="para7">
        Set a bunch of goals for myself that I can truly be proud of
        achieving.
      </p>

      <hr></hr>
      <p class="goals"> The List </p>
      <p class="disclaimer">The list was kept secret until the thirties arrived. I had made
      goals previously where just telling people about the goal, and hearing
      nice things was enough dopamine, and I never ended up completing the
      task.<br> This wouldn't be one of those times.</p>
